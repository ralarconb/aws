# [Host Your Application On A Web Server](https://aws.amazon.com/es/getting-started/projects/build-modern-app-fargate-lambda-dynamodb-python/module-two/)
- For our Mythical Mysfits backend, we will use Python and create a Flask app in a Docker container behind a Network Load Balancer. These will form the microservice backend for the frontend website.
- We chose Fargate here because it's a great choice for building long-running processes such as microservices backends for web and mobile and PaaS platforms. With Fargate, you get the control of containers and the flexibility to choose when they run without worrying about provisioning or scaling servers. It offers full control of networking, security, and service to service communication and is natively integrated with AWS services for security, networking, access control, developer tooling, monitoring, and logging.
- In addition to Fargate, customers also have the option of using AWS Lambda for their compute needs. While Lambda offers the same serverless benefits as Fargate, Lambda is great for data-driven applications that need to respond in real-time to changes in data, shifts in system state, or actions by users.
